# Introduction

This repository includes exemples of processing/analysis pipelines for biomedical data that I have engineered over the years.

Due to the proprietary nature of the code underlying these pipelines, I am not allowed to share it. However, you will find in this repository folders exemples of the input and output of these pipelines run on anonymized data when relevant.

More detailed explanations of the pipelines are included in their respective folders

# Pipeline list
