# Portfolio
## Introduction

This repository includes exemples of processing/analysis pipelines for biomedical data that I have engineered over the years.

Due to the proprietary nature of the code underlying these pipelines, I am not allowed to share it. However, you will find in this repository folders exemples of the input and output of these pipelines run on anonymized data when relevant.

## Included pipelines (WIP)

### Sanger DNA sequencing for phage display plasmids
### Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data processing and analysis pipelines for phage display plasmids
### High-throughput real-time cell-based assays
### Flow cytometry-based cell characterisation and ligand/receptor interactions
### Peptide/protein immunogenicity predictions
### Data mining for GPCR classification and GPCR/ligand interaction cataloguing
### HPLC data extraction and archiving
