## Introduction

This repository includes exemples of processing/analysis pipelines for biomedical data that I have engineered over the years.

Due to the proprietary nature of the code underlying these pipelines, I am not allowed to share it. However, you will find in this repository folders exemples of the input and output of these pipelines run on anonymized data when relevant.
