# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Introduction

This repository includes exemples of automated processing/analysis wokflows that I have engineered as part of a drug discovery platform using phage display technologies.

Due to the proprietary nature of the code underlying these pipelines, I am not allowed to share it. However, you will find in this repository folders exemples of the input and output of these pipelines run on anonymized data when relevant.

More detailed explanations of the pipelines are included in their respective folders
